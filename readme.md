# 🧠 Daily LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily LeetCode Challenge** repository!  
This repo is my personal commitment to improving problem-solving skills, sharpening DSA concepts, and preparing for coding interviews — one problem at a time.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To solve **at least one LeetCode problem every day** and document the solution, approach, and improvements.  
This helps build consistency, strengthens logic, and keeps me sharp for real-world problem solving.

## 📂 Repository Structure

**Repository Structure**

- daily-leetcode-challenge/
  - Day01/
    - solution.java (or .py / .js / .cpp)
    - README.md (problem + explanation)
  - Day02/
    - solution.java
    - README.md
  - ...
  - README.md (main)


Each folder contains:
- The code solution  
- A brief explanation / thought process  
- Time & Space complexity  
- (Optional) Alternative approaches

## 📘 What I’m Practicing

- Algorithms (Greedy, DP, Backtracking, Divide & Conquer)  
- Data Structures (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps, Heaps, Stacks, Queues)  
- Patterns (Two-pointer, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Prefix sums, etc.)  
- Clean code and structured thinking  
- Multiple languages (if needed)
